This repo is a dump of some code I've done during my course on electronics and telecommunications engineering.
It contains code from different subjects that I could find in some lost drives. Most of the material I had was lost. 
This was uploaded for future reference if needed.

- __ac2 (computer architecture II, 2nd year)__: microcontroller programming with assembly and C; contains resolutions of practical guides and exams.
- __e4 (electronics 4, 4th year)__: microcontroller programming with C/C++; contains a project of a ball in a plane controller with discrete PID, the full final report with electronics schematics, and utility code (UART, ADC, ...).
- __iaps (introduction to analysis and signal processing, 2nd year)__: mainly practical guides and exams solutions done in matlab.
- __lsd (digital systems laboratory, 1st year)__: VHDL practical guides solutions; project of a synthesizer made in a FPGA.
- __industrial informatics (5th year - optional subject mechanical department): implementation of the weekly practical exercises.
- __statistical learning and neural networks (5th year - ERASMUS at PoliTo, Turim Italy)__: resolutions of the practical guides.
