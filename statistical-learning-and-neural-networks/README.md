<p align="center">This repostiry contains the resolutions of the 01SOVBH Statistical Learning and Neural Networks subject practical guides taught at Politecnico di Torino. This resolutions were done during the ERASMUS program at the university during the academic year of 2018/2019.

### Reports

- [Report 1: K-NN Classifier](https://github.com/dvcorreia/statistical-learning-and-neural-networks/blob/master/SSP%20Lab%201/Report_1__K_NN_Classifier.pdf)
- [Report 2: Model fitting and classification](https://github.com/dvcorreia/statistical-learning-and-neural-networks/blob/master/SSP%20Lab%202/Report_2__Model_fitting_and_classification.pdf)

- [Report 4: Kalman filter]()

### Issues

The Neural networks guide is still to be done aswell has the kalman filter guide number 4.
All of the implementations are yet to be validated, so this solutions might not be correct.
